# rag_n_chat
New Reposiroty for Ideation and Design of a Rag and Chat API / Application

## Possible Tools
- [excallidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for designing and ideas
- [pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) for possible vector DB storage
- [tavily](https://tavily.com/) for possible searching ability
- [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for any localish small scale data to store for the app
- [Back4App](https://www.back4app.com/) possible deployment for containers
- [Render](https://render.com/) other possible deployment option for spike projects
- add to this as needed...

## Some thought process
- Ideate over a few things
- plan a generic rag with chat type application
- decide where the data needs to come from for ragging
- decide where the data needs to be stored
- create a simple chatbot that can be chatted with based upon the data that has been stored
- decided if we need to have any further functionality for future features, such as search, multiple sources or other complexities
- build out some features and make some spike projects / mini versions of features to help with the design process

during this process some tools such as excallidraw and other diagramming tools may be used to get ideas and designs down, along with maybe markdown or other tooling to get thoughts on to the screen / stored in repo
